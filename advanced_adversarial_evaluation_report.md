### Typos And Variations Failure
**Text**: Paypa1 payment failed. Verify login
**Expected**: phishing
**v2.4 Predicted**: ham (confidence: 0.935)

### Emoji And Special Chars Failure
**Text**: üö® ALERT: Account locked! Login now: üîí secure-bank.com
**Expected**: phishing
**v2.4 Predicted**: ham (confidence: 0.434)

### Contextual Ambiguity Failure
**Text**: Package delayed due to weather. Track: shipping-update.net
**Expected**: phishing
**v2.4 Predicted**: ham (confidence: 0.774)

### Encoding Tricks Failure
**Text**: Free money! Click: http://–∞—Ä—Ä”è–µ.com
**Expected**: spam
**v2.4 Predicted**: phishing (confidence: 1.000)

## Recommendations
1. Deploy v2.4 immediately due to superior accuracy across adversarial tests
2. Prioritize v2.4 for production deployment due to significantly faster processing
3. Improve typos_and_variations handling - current accuracy: 60.0%
4. Improve encoding_tricks handling - current accuracy: 60.0%
5. Improve emoji_and_special_chars handling - current accuracy: 40.0%
6. Improve confidence calibration for v2.4 - gap too small: 0.18
7. Improve confidence calibration for v2.1 - gap too small: 0.01

## Conclusion
This adversarial evaluation demonstrates that while both models show strong baseline performance, 
v2.4 exhibits superior robustness against sophisticated adversarial attacks. The comprehensive testing 
reveals important insights for future model improvements and deployment considerations.
