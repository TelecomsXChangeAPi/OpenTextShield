## Recommendations
1. **Weak Areas Identified**:
   - Most common error: ham misclassified as spam (5 times)
2. **Data Augmentation Needed**:
   - Generate more samples for error-prone categories
   - Add multilingual data for underrepresented languages
   - Include more edge cases in training
3. **Model Improvements**:
   - Fine-tune on augmented dataset
   - Consider ensemble methods for uncertain predictions
   - Implement confidence thresholding
