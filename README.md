Detection: A Comparative Study of FastText and BERT

Author: Ameed Jamous

## Abstract:

This study delves into the application of artificial intelligence in creating an effective SMS spam firewall, focusing on the utilization of advanced models like FastText and BERT. The paper emphasizes the crucial role of collaborative, open-source initiatives in addressing the challenges posed by the diverse linguistic nature of spam messages. It underscores the pivotal importance of high-quality data for training and refining these models, highlighting the necessity for community-based support in providing both resources and financial backing. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of spam detection but also fosters a more inclusive and adaptive framework for combating spam across various languages.

### 1. Introduction

With SMS spam evolving in complexity and varying across languages, traditional filtering methods fall short. AI, particularly machine learning models like FastText and BERT, offers a more dynamic solution. The effectiveness of these models hinges on diverse, high-quality training data, emphasizing the need for a collaborative, open-source approach in the telecom sector.

### 2. Overview of FastText and BERT

FastText Overview

FastText is a text representation and classification library developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in 2016. It is designed to efficiently learn word representations and sentence classification. FastText extends the Word2Vec model by treating each word as composed of character n-grams, allowing it to capture the meaning of shorter words and to understand suffixes and prefixes.



Key Features of FastText:

- Subword Information: FastText represents words as bags of character n-grams, in addition to the whole word itself. This is particularly useful for languages with rich morphology and for understanding words outside the training dataset (out-of-vocabulary words).
- Efficiency: FastText is designed to be highly scalable and can train models on large corpora quickly, making it practical for large-scale applications.
- Word Representations: It provides word embeddings that are useful for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
- Text Classification: FastText can be used for supervised text classification with a simple linear model that is both efficient and effective.

Applications of FastText:
- Sentiment Analysis
- Language Identification
- Word Embed


BERT Overview

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformative approach to pretraining language representations introduced by Google AI in 2018. It represents a significant breakthrough in the field of natural language processing (NLP).

Key Features of BERT:
- Bidirectionality: BERT processes words in relation to all the other words in a sentence, rather than one-by-one in order.
- Deep Contextualized Representation: Each word can have different meanings based on its context, which BERT captures effectively.
- Pretraining and Fine-tuning: BERT is first pre-trained on a large corpus of text and then fine-tuned for specific tasks with additional layers.

Applications of BERT:

- BERT has been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in a variety of NLP tasks, including question answering, language inference, and named entity recognition.

BERT's impact on NLP has been profound, leading to the development of numerous variants and models inspired by its architecture and training approach.


###  3. Methodology
The methodology section explains the data preparation process, stressing the importance of linguistic diversity in the dataset. We detail the training process for both models, highlighting the need for post-training tuning to adapt to specific spam trends, which is best achieved through collaborative efforts.

###  4. Hardware Configurations and Response Times


FastText is known for its efficiency and speed, particularly in the context of text classification. It can train on millions of words per second and can classify thousands of sentences in a matter of milliseconds per sentence on standard CPU hardware. This is due to its relatively simple architecture that uses linear models with rank constraint and fast text representation using hashing trick for n-grams.

BERT, on the other hand, is a much larger and more complex model that requires significantly more computational resources, especially during the fine-tuning and inference stages. BERT's response times are typically slower than FastText's due to the complexity of the Transformer architecture it's based on, which involves multiple layers of attention mechanisms and a large number of parameters.

For example, on a classification task, FastText might process sentences in less than 10 milliseconds per sentence on a CPU, while BERT might take several tens of milliseconds to a few hundred milliseconds per sentence on the same CPU. The exact times can vary widely depending on the specific hardware used, the length of the input text, the complexity of the model (e.g., BERT Base vs. BERT Large), and whether you're using a GPU or TPU to accelerate processing.

It's important to note that while FastText is faster, BERT generally provides a higher level of accuracy due to its deep contextualized representations. Therefore, the choice between FastText and BERT often comes down to a trade-off between speed and accuracy.

For actual benchmarks, you would need to refer to the latest research papers or perform your own tests using the specific hardware and datasets you're interested in. Benchmarks can be highly variable and are influenced by many factors, including optimizations in the model implementation, the version of the libraries used (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), and the precision of the computations (e.g., FP32 vs. FP16).


An evaluation of model performance across various hardware setups illustrates the necessity of community contributions in computing power. These contributions are vital for achieving optimal response times and processing capabilities, especially in resource-intensive models like BERT.



### 5. Practical Implementation

Below are examples of how you might train a FastText model and a BERT model for the specific task of SMS spam message classification.

FastText Model Training for SMS Spam Classification:

```python
import fasttext

# Assuming you have a file named 'sms_spam_data.txt' where each line is formatted as:
# '__label__spam This is a spam message'
# '__label__ham This is a ham (not spam) message'

# Train the FastText classifier
model = fasttext.train_supervised(input='sms_spam_data.txt')

# Save the model
model.save_model('sms_spam_fasttext.bin')

# Evaluate the model (optional)
print(model.test('sms_spam_data.txt'))
```

BERT Model Training for SMS Spam Classification:

For BERT, we'll use the Hugging Face Transformers library and PyTorch. Make sure you have a dataset ready, with texts and labels separated for training.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

# Load the BERT tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Prepare the dataset
class SMSSpamDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts, labels):
        self.encodings = tokenizer(texts, truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=128)
        self.labels = labels

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        item = {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) for key, val in self.encodings.items()}
        item['labels'] = torch.tensor(self.labels[idx])
        return item

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.labels)

# Replace `texts` and `labels` with your data
# texts = ["This is a spam message", "This is a ham message"]
# labels = [1, 0] # 1 for spam, 0 for ham
train_dataset = SMSSpamDataset(texts, labels)

# Load the BERT model for sequence classification
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          # output directory
    num_train_epochs=3,              # total number of training epochs
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,  # batch size per device during training
    warmup_steps=100,                # number of warmup steps for learning rate scheduler
    weight_decay=0.01,               # strength of weight decay
    logging_dir='./logs',            # directory for storing logs
)

# Initialize the Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()

# Save the model
model.save_pretrained('sms_spam_bert')
tokenizer.save_pretrained('sms_spam_bert')
```

In this BERT example, you need to replace the `texts` and `labels` variables with your actual SMS spam dataset. The `SMSSpamDataset` class is a custom dataset class that processes the text data for use with BERT.

Please note that for both examples, you would need to preprocess your dataset to fit the expected format. For FastText, each line in the text file should contain a label and the corresponding message. For BERT, you should have lists of texts and labels ready for input into the `SMSSpamDataset` class.

These examples are simplified and intended for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, we would need to split the data into training and validation sets, perform more thorough preprocessing, and handle various other aspects of the machine learning workflow, such as model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.




### 6. Comparative Analysis: Fine-Tuning FastText and BERT for Regional Language Variations in Spam Detection

The proliferation of spam messages across various communication channels necessitates robust spam detection systems. FastText and BERT are two powerful machine learning models that can be fine-tuned for spam detection, including the challenging task of adapting to regional language variations. The open-source community, particularly contributors from the telecom industry, plays a vital role in enhancing these models' effectiveness. This comparative analysis explores how FastText and BERT can be fine-tuned for regional language variations in spam and the benefits of community contributions.

FastText Fine-Tuning for Regional Languages:

FastText, with its n-gram based approach, is particularly well-suited for languages with rich morphology and compounding, which are common in regional languages.
